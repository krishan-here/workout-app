# workout-app

- Workout app will turn to be a tracking individual workout(sets and reps).
- Can store images so that user can understand good posture.


I am going to use React-native to build this app. I am planning to make this without backend.

I am learning React-native. so let's see when we start working on it. I have built some figma designs but those are not optimal. so let's see when it will become good to start working on the project.

Steps to follow this app:
1. Build some basic ui.
2. planning to track workout routine.


Want some guidance to proceed with it. let see who can help us.
